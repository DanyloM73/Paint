# Paint

🎨 Simple mobile application for Android for drawing

## ❔ What can it do?

This application allows you to draw shapes on the canvas such as **a point, a straight line, a rectangle, an ellipse, a cube, and a line with two circles at the ends**. 
What you draw can be saved in a special configuration file in **JSON format**, which will be saved to the device’s memory. 
A file of this format can be opened in the future in the program and you can see the drawing that was saved in this file. 
Each drawn shape is saved in a **special table**, in which you can see its **name and coordinates**, starting and ending. 
Everything drawn on the canvas can also be deleted by pressing one button; you can also delete a specific shape through the above-mentioned table.

## 🛠️ What is planned to be added/changed?

- More shapes
- More shapes customization
- New tools, like going one step back or one step forward
